    BioWare's next action RPG, Anthem, was the star of EA's keynote at E3 2018. And I learned some interesting information about the game. BioWare's Casey Hudson, Mark Darrah, and Cathleen Rootsaert answered questions about the game with a focus on the story. Humans play a character known as a freelancer who must protect civilization from several precarious disasters, such as an approaching storm and competition with a group of humans known as Dominions. Players control an exosuit called javelin throw and embark on a large mission with friends based on open-world gameplay. The player plays the role of a character called a freelancer. Freelancers are dispatched to missions to interact with other players, collect resources, and confront enemy combatants. The goal is to protect the national anthem from both the coming storm and the Dominion, and to protect the world they know. Players belong to different villages where you can interact with other people. The settlement featured in the EA Play 2018 demo was Fort Tharsis.
